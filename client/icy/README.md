# ICY Flutter Application

## Getting Started

Welcome to the ICY Flutter project! This guide will help new developers understand the workflow and contribution process for our company's Duolingo-like clone.

### Development Workflow

1. **Work on Branches**
    - Always create a new branch for features or fixes
    - Never commit directly to the main branch
    - Name branches meaningfully (e.g., `feature/login-screen`, `bugfix/navigation-error`)

2. **Making Changes**
    - Make frequent, small commits with clear messages
    - Keep your branch updated with the main branch

3. **Pull Requests**
    - When your feature/fix is complete, create a pull request
    - Add a description explaining the changes
    - Request reviews from team members
    - Respond to feedback and make necessary changes

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter run` to start the application
