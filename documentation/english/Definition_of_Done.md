# Definition of Done (DoD)

## Overview

The Definition of Done is a clear and concise list of requirements that a software product must adhere to for the team to call a product increment "done". ICY development adheres to the following DoD criteria:

## For Individual Features/User Stories

A feature or user story is considered "Done" when:

- [x] All acceptance criteria are met and verified
- [x] Code is written according to the project's coding standards and guidelines
- [x] Code is properly commented and documented
- [x] Unit tests are written with adequate coverage (minimum 80%)
- [x] Integration tests are written where applicable
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] UI/UX designs are implemented as specified
- [x] Code has been reviewed by at least one other developer
- [x] API endpoints are properly documented (if applicable)
- [x] Feature is tested on both iOS and Android platforms
- [x] Localization is implemented where needed
- [x] Accessibility requirements are met
- [x] No high or medium priority bugs exist
- [x] All edge cases are handled
- [x] Performance meets specified requirements

## For Sprint Completion

A sprint is considered "Done" when:

- [x] All planned stories have met the individual DoD
- [x] Product increment is demoed and approved by Product Owner
- [x] Technical documentation is updated
- [x] User documentation is updated (if applicable)
- [x] Build can be installed on all supported platforms
- [x] Backend changes (if any) are deployed to staging environment
- [x] Integration tests run on staging environment are successful
- [x] Sprint retrospective is conducted

## For Release

A release is considered "Done" when:

- [x] All sprint DoD criteria are met
- [x] User acceptance testing is complete
- [x] Performance testing shows acceptable results
- [x] Security scanning shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [x] Data privacy requirements are met
- [x] Release notes are created
- [x] Product is submitted to app stores (if applicable)
- [x] Deployment checklist is completed
- [x] Post-release monitoring plan is in place
- [x] Customer support team is briefed

## Quality Gates

1. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed by peers
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
3. **Static Analysis**: Code must pass static analysis tools
4. **Performance**: App must start within 3 seconds, screen transitions must be under 300ms
5. **Security**: No critical or high priority vulnerabilities

## Tools and Processes

- Version Control: Git with GitHub
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
