# ICY Application Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the ICY application, covering all aspects of testing from unit tests to user acceptance testing.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

**Scope:** Individual components, functions, methods, and classes

**Tools:**
- Flutter test framework for frontend
- Jest for backend

**Approach:**
- Test all business logic in isolation
- Mock dependencies using Mockito (for Flutter) or Jest mocks (for Node.js)
- Aim for high coverage (target: 80%+)
- TDD (Test-Driven Development) encouraged for complex features

### 2. Widget/Component Testing

**Scope:** UI components in isolation

**Tools:**
- Flutter widget testing
- Golden tests for visual regression

**Approach:**
- Test widget rendering and behavior
- Verify UI state changes based on input
- Test user interactions with widgets
- Compare widget screenshots with golden images

### 3. Integration Testing

**Scope:** Interactions between components or services

**Tools:**
- Flutter integration_test package
- Supertest for backend API testing

**Approach:**
- Test BLoC integration with repositories
- Test repository integration with data sources
- Test API endpoints' behavior with database
- Verify correct data flow through the system

### 4. End-to-End Testing

**Scope:** Full user flows through the application

**Tools:**
- Flutter integration_test for app flows
- Postman collections for API flows

**Approach:**
- Simulate real user scenarios
- Test critical paths (login, surveys, achievements, etc.)
- Cross-platform testing (iOS and Android)
- Different device sizes and configurations

### 5. Performance Testing

**Scope:** Application performance under various conditions

**Tools:**
- Flutter DevTools
- JMeter for backend load testing

**Metrics:**
- App startup time (target: < 3 seconds)
- UI responsiveness (target: 60 FPS)
- API response times (target: < 200ms)
- Memory usage profiles

### 6. Security Testing

**Scope:** Application security vulnerabilities

**Approach:**
- Static code analysis with security plugins
- API penetration testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Data encryption verification
- Input validation and sanitization testing

### 7. Accessibility Testing

**Scope:** Application usability for users with disabilities

**Tools:**
- Flutter accessibility tools
- Manual testing with screen readers

**Approach:**
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Verify sufficient contrast ratios
- Test keyboard navigation
- Ensure appropriate text scaling

### 8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Scope:** Verification that the system meets business requirements

**Approach:**
- Involvement of stakeholders and end-users
- Scenario-based testing aligned with use cases
- Feedback collection and prioritization
- Sign-off process for features

## Testing Environments

1. **Development Environment:** Used by developers for local testing
2. **Test Environment:** Used for automated tests and QA testing
3. **Staging Environment:** Production-like environment for final verification
4. **Production Environment:** Live application environment

## Test Data Management

- Use of factories and fixtures for consistent test data
- Database seeding scripts for integration and E2E tests
- Separation between test and production data
- GDPR-compliant test data handling

## Continuous Integration & Testing

- Automated test execution on every pull request
- Daily full test suite runs on main branch
- Test reports and coverage metrics published
- Blocking issues prevent merging

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

- All bugs documented in issue tracking system
- Severity and priority assigned to each bug
- Regression tests created for each fixed bug
- Bug bash sessions scheduled before major releases

## Testing Responsibilities

- **Developers:** Unit tests, widget tests, fix issues
- **QA Team:** Integration tests, E2E tests, exploratory testing
- **DevOps:** CI/CD pipeline, test environment maintenance
- **Product Owners:** UAT coordination, acceptance criteria validation

## Release Criteria

- All tests pass in the staging environment
- Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- No critical or high-priority bugs open
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- UAT completed and signed off by stakeholders
